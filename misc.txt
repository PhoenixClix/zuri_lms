In views, there might be a class defined as 
class ViewSearch:
    Takes name and searches the database for that name. This is the logic/processing/controller/application
    return "found", "not found"





    SQL
    SELECT * FROM database;
    CREATE TABLE table_name(
        char    first_name;
        int     age;
    )


    1)  name    id      type=Basic Description
    2)  name    id      type=Basic Description
    3)  name    id      type

create table new_polls_question(
